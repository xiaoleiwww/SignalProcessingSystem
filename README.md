# SignalProcessingSystem

The Signal Processing System project is a simple python based project for signal processing. The project contains different signal generators. The code can be utilised for the learning of the signal and systems, DSP, etc.

# Structure of the system

The system contains three components:

1 A variety of signal generators which can generate formula data used sympy, or generate sampling points data based on python. The function includes linear/nonlinear.

2 A processing function. The function will give the formula of the convolution signal.

3 Visualization using matplotlib.
