Signal and Systems

# Learning objects
Digital Signal Processing  
DSP: Digital signal processor (utilise chip maybe)

# Analog and digital
Analog: C-T (Continous-Time Signal)  
Digital: D-T (Discrete-Time Signal)

# TTL and CMOS

TTL voltages is shown in here:
    1 -> 5V
    0 -> 0V

CMOS voltages is shown in here:
    1 -> 3.3V
    0 -> 0V

# Theory
Numerical analysis, z-transform and DFT theory are bases.  
FFT makes DSP applications practical.  
Digital signal processing theory appeared one century ago.

# Obtain D-T signal
There are three ways to obtain D-T signal:
* Sampling

# Several elementary of D-T signal
## Unit sample sequence
